    "The series is one of the core data structures in pandas. It is like a crossover between a list and a dictionary. The items are stored in an order and there's labels with which you can retrieve them. An easy way to visualize this is two columns of data. The first is the special index, a lot like keys in a dictionary. While the second is your actual data. It's important to note that the data column has a label of its own and can be retrieved using the .name attribute. This is different than with dictionaries and is useful when it comes to merging multiple columns of data."
